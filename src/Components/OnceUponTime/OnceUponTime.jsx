      Stargate Media started with a small group of eager young adults who
        bonded over their shared love for writing and coffee. We were literature
        enthusiasts, wordsmiths, avid readers, and nerds for cult classics. We
        spent hours engaged in writing prompts, short stories, slam poetry, fan
        fiction, anything and everything in some way or the other connected to
        literature and creative writing.

        Colleagues, friends, friends of friends, and even strangers with whom we
        debated on the internet, would often recognize our spark and come to us
        with help regarding their thesis, project reports, blogs, etc. The spark
        turned into a flame slowly and gradually, and we had started to find it
        hard to fulfill our kind promises.
